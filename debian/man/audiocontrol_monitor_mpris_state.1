.SH NAME
audiocontrol_monitor_mpris_state \- monitor MPRIS player state changes in real-time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B audiocontrol_monitor_mpris_state
.I PLAYER_IDENTIFIER
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B audiocontrol_monitor_mpris_state
monitors MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification) property changes 
for a specified media player in real-time. It displays changes to playback status, 
track metadata, volume, position, and other player properties as they occur.
.PP
The tool works by polling the specified MPRIS player every 500ms and comparing 
the current state with the previous state. When changes are detected, they are 
displayed with timestamps showing what properties changed and their old and new values.
.PP
This tool is similar to running dbus-monitor with appropriate filters, but provides 
formatted output and uses the same player selection mechanism as other audiocontrol 
MPRIS tools.
