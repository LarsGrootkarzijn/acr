[00:05.10] Circuits humming in the night
[00:08.75] Neon colors paint the sky
[00:12.40] Digital dreams are calling out
[00:16.05] Time to spread my wings and fly
[00:19.70] 

[00:23.35] Code and pixels dancing free
[00:27.00] In this virtual reality
[00:30.65] Every byte tells a story
[00:34.30] Of electric glory
[00:37.95] 

[00:41.60] Digital dreams, digital dreams
[00:45.25] Nothing is quite what it seems
[00:48.90] In this world of ones and zeros
[00:52.55] We're all digital heroes
[00:56.20] 

[01:15.80] Algorithms guide my way
[01:19.45] Through the data streams today
