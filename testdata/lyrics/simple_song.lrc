[ti:Simple Song]
[ar:Folk Artist]
[al:Acoustic Collection]

[00:01.00] This is just a simple song
[00:04.50] 
[00:07.00] With some empty lines between
[00:10.50] 
[00:13.00] To test the parsing works
[00:16.50] 
[00:19.00] Even when there's nothing there
[00:22.50] 
[00:25.00] Just a timestamp and a pause
[00:28.50] 
[00:31.00] That's how LRC files work
