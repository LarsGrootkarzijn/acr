WebSocket integration tests for AudioControl system
Tests the WebSocket event notifications when player state changes

IMPORTANT: We've identified several issues with the generic player's API event support:

1. Despite configuring "supports_api_events": True in conftest.py, the server does not
   expose this setting in the API response.
   
2. When sending events to the player, the API returns:
   {'success': False, 'message': 'Failed to process event or processor disabled'}
   
3. Although the code in generic_controller.rs has methods to handle events like
   song_changed and metadata_changed, these events don't seem to be processed when
   sent via the API.
   
4. The player reports empty capabilities via the API, which may be related.

These tests are included for documentation and will be skipped if the feature
is not available. They will automatically pass if WebSocket event support is enabled.

TO FIX THIS TEST:
- Check if event processing is correctly enabled in the backend code
- Ensure that API events are properly passed to the process_api_event method
- Update the player API response to include the supports_api_events flag
- Check the server logs for any error messages when events are submitted

For reference, the conftest.py configuration already includes "supports_api_events": True
for the generic player, but this setting doesn't seem to be honored by the server.
