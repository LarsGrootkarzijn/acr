## Base Information

- **Base URL**: `http://<device-ip>:1080`
- **API Prefix**: All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`
- **Content Type**: All responses are in JSON format
- **Version**: As per current package version

## Events

The Audiocontrol system uses an event-based architecture to communicate state changes between components. Events can be monitored via WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE).

For detailed information about WebSocket communication, message formats, and event types, see the [WebSocket API documentation](websocket.md).

### Player Events

These events are emitted when a player's state changes:

- `StateChanged` - Player state has changed (playing, paused, stopped, etc.)
- `SongChanged` - Current song has changed
- `LoopModeChanged` - Loop mode has changed
- `CapabilitiesChanged` - Player capabilities have changed
- `PositionChanged` - Playback position has changed
- `DatabaseUpdating` - Database is being updated
- `QueueChanged` - Queue content has changed (note: many players might not actively emit this event when their queue changes)

Note: Not all players actively emit all event types. In particular, queue changes might not be detected automatically for some player implementations. In this case, manual polling of the queue endpoint might be necessary.

## Core API

```

### Player Event Update

Receives player events via API endpoint. This endpoint allows external systems to send event notifications to players that support API event processing.

**Purpose**: External systems (like Spotify Connect, RAAT bridges, or other audio services) can use this endpoint to inform players about events that occurred elsewhere, such as track changes, playback state changes, or other player-related events.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/player/<player-name>/update`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**: JSON event data in a format specific to the player
- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Event processed successfully"
  }
  ```

- **Error Response** (400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error):

  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "Error message"
  }
  ```

**Note**: Not all players support API event processing. Currently, only Librespot implements this functionality.

#### Player Event API Examples

```bash
# Send a track_changed event to Librespot
curl -X POST http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/librespot/update \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "some_event"
  }'
# Response: {"success": false, "message": "Player 'mpd' does not support API event processing"}
```

### Get Now Playing Information

```

### Get Player Queue

Retrieves the current queue for a specific player.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/player/<player-name>/queue`
- **Method**: GET
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `player-name` (string): The name of the player. You can use "active" to target the currently active player.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "player": "player-name",
    "queue": [
      {
        "id": "track-id-1",

  ```
- **Error Response** (404 Not Found): 
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "Player 'player-name' not found"
  }
  ```

**Player Support**: Queue retrieval is supported by most players, but the level of detail varies:
- **MPD**: Full queue support with track metadata
- **LMS (Logitech Media Server)**: Full queue support with detailed track information
- **Generic Players**: Queue managed internally through API
- **MPRIS**: Limited queue support (many MPRIS players don't expose queue)
- **RAAT**: Returns empty queue (queue management handled externally)
- **Spotify/Librespot**: Returns empty queue (managed by Spotify service)

**Note**: While some players emit `QueueChanged` events when their queue is modified (such as when tracks are added, removed, or reordered), many player implementations might not actively inform about these updates. If you're building a UI that displays queue content, you may need to periodically poll this endpoint to ensure the display remains current.

#### Examples
```bash
# Get queue for MPD player
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/mpd/queue

# Get queue for LMS player
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/lms/queue

# Get queue for the currently active player
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/active/queue
```

### Queue Management Commands

# Response: {"success": false, "message": "Queue operations not supported by this player type"}
```

#### Queue Track Metadata Structure

When adding tracks to the queue, you can provide optional metadata that will be cached by certain players (especially MPD). This metadata can enhance the song information when the track is played:

```json
{
  "uri": "string (required)",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "string (optional) - Track title",
    "artist": "string (optional) - Artist name", 
    "album": "string (optional) - Album name",
    "coverart_url": "string (optional) - URL to cover art image",
    "duration": "number (optional) - Track duration in seconds",
    "genre": "string (optional) - Music genre",
    "year": "number (optional) - Release year",
    "custom_field": "any (optional) - Any custom metadata field"
  }
}
```

**Metadata Usage**:
- **MPD**: Stores metadata in an LRU cache (max 1000 entries) and automatically enhances songs when they match the cached URL
- **LMS**: Stores metadata for API-driven playback enhancement
- **Generic Players**: Uses metadata for display and tracking purposes
- **Other Players**: Metadata may be ignored if not supported

**Important Notes**:
- **No Fixed Semantics**: The metadata has no enforced semantics or validation. Field names and values are suggestions only.
- **Player-Specific Handling**: Each player implementation can choose to ignore metadata entirely, handle only specific fields, or process all fields according to their own logic.
- **No Guarantees**: There is no guarantee that provided metadata will be used, stored, or displayed by any player.
- **Best Effort**: Metadata should be considered "best effort" hints to improve the user experience when supported.

**Flexible Schema**: The metadata object accepts any key-value pairs, allowing for custom fields beyond the common ones listed above. All values are stored as JSON values and can be strings, numbers, booleans, or complex objects.

### Queue Events

When queue operations are performed, players may emit events to notify about changes:

- **`QueueChanged`**: Emitted when tracks are added, removed, or reordered
- **`PlaylistChanged`**: Emitted when the current playlist/queue is replaced

**Event Monitoring**: You can listen for these events through the WebSocket API or by polling the queue endpoint periodically.

### Queue Position Indexing

**Important**: Queue positions and indices are **zero-based** across all operations:
- Position `0` = First track in queue
- Position `1` = Second track in queue  
- Position `n-1` = Last track in queue (where n = queue length)

When removing tracks or playing by index, ensure you account for zero-based indexing to avoid off-by-one errors.

### Get Player Metadata

Retrieves all metadata for a specific player.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/player/<player-name>/meta`
- **Method**: GET
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `player-name` (string): The name of the player. You can use "active" to target the currently active player.

#### Checking Player Capabilities

You can query a player's capabilities programmatically:

```bash
# Get capabilities for a specific player (through metadata)
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/mpd/meta

# Check if a player supports queue operations before attempting them
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/player/mpd/queue
```

When building applications, always check player capabilities before attempting operations to provide appropriate fallbacks or UI elements.

### Volume Control Notes

- **Hardware Dependency**: Volume control availability depends on the underlying hardware and ALSA configuration
- **System-Wide**: This controls the system's hardware volume, not individual player volumes
- **Range Limits**: Volume values are automatically clamped to valid ranges (0-100% for percentage)
- **Multiple Formats**: You can set volume using percentage (0-100), decibels (if supported), or raw hardware values
- **Priority**: When multiple values are provided in a set request, percentage takes priority, followed by decibels, then raw value
- **Monitoring**: Some systems support volume change monitoring to detect external volume changes (e.g., hardware volume buttons)

#### Configuration Requirements

The favourites API requires at least one provider to be configured. Available providers include:

**SettingsDB Provider** (Local Storage):
- Always available
- Stores favourites in the local database
- No additional configuration required
- `enabled`: Always true when database is accessible
- `active`: Always true when enabled (no authentication required)

**Last.fm Provider**:
- Requires Last.fm API credentials and user authentication
- `enabled`: True when API credentials are configured
- `active`: True when user is logged in/authenticated with Last.fm
- Configuration example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "lastfm": {
      "enable": true,
      "api_key": "your_lastfm_api_key",
      "api_secret": "your_lastfm_api_secret",
      "now_playing_enabled": true,
      "scrobble": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Spotify Provider** (Read-Only):
- Requires Spotify authentication via OAuth
- Only supports checking if songs are favourites (read-only)
- Adding/removing favourites must be done through the Spotify app
- `enabled`: True when user has valid Spotify authentication tokens
- `active`: True when enabled (same as enabled for Spotify)
- Uses Spotify Web API to search for songs and check saved track status
- No additional configuration required beyond OAuth authentication

#### Response Format Notes

- All favourites API responses are wrapped in `Ok` for successful operations or `Err` for errors
- The `updated_providers` field shows which providers actually processed the operation successfully
- The `providers` field in favourite status checks returns human-readable display names (e.g., "Last.fm", "Spotify") for better user experience
- Case sensitivity depends on the provider implementation (SettingsDB is case-insensitive)
- Unicode and special characters in artist/title names are supported
- Spotify provider is read-only: it can check favourite status but cannot add/remove favourites

#### Error Handling

Common error scenarios:

- **Missing Parameters**: HTTP 400 with error message
- **Empty Strings**: HTTP 400 with validation error message  
- **Invalid JSON**: HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **Provider Errors**: Logged but don't prevent other providers from working
- **No Providers Available**: Operations will complete but may have empty `updated_providers`

## Lyrics API

The Lyrics API provides endpoints to retrieve song lyrics for supported players. Currently, only MPD-based players are supported. The API is designed with provider-specific endpoints to allow for future expansion to other music sources.

**Requirements for MPD:**
- Lyrics files must be in `.lrc` format (plain text or timed lyrics)
- Files must be placed alongside music files with the same name but `.lrc` extension
- Both plain text and LRC timed format are supported

For detailed information about the lyrics system, supported formats, file structure, and examples, see the [Lyrics API documentation](lyrics_api.md).

### Get Lyrics by Song ID

Retrieve lyrics for a specific song using its provider-specific song ID.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/lyrics/{provider}/{song_id}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `provider` (string): The lyrics provider (currently only "mpd" is supported)
  - `song_id` (string): The provider-specific song ID. For MPD: base64-encoded file path of the song

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:1080/api/lyrics/mpd/bXVzaWMvQXJ0aXN0L0FsYnVtL1NvbmcuZmxhYw"
```

**Note**: For MPD, the `song_id` is a URL-safe base64-encoded version of the song's file path. This ID is automatically provided in the song metadata when lyrics are available.

### Get Lyrics by Metadata

Retrieve lyrics by providing song metadata (artist, title, etc.) for a specific provider.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/lyrics/{provider}`
- **Method**: POST
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `provider` (string): The lyrics provider (currently only "mpd" is supported)
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "artist": "Artist Name",
    "title": "Song Title",
    "duration": 180.5,
    "album": "Album Name"
  }
  ```

**Required Fields:**
- `artist`: Artist name (string)
- `title`: Song title (string)

**Optional Fields:**
- `duration`: Song duration in seconds (number)
- `album`: Album name (string)

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:1080/api/lyrics/mpd" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "artist": "Example Artist",
    "title": "Example Song"
  }'
```

**Response Format (both endpoints):**

Success with timed lyrics:
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "lyrics": {
    "type": "timed",
    "lyrics": [
      {
        "timestamp": 0.0,
        "text": "Verse 1 starts here"
      },
      {
        "timestamp": 15.5,
        "text": "Chorus begins"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Success with plain text:
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "lyrics": {
    "type": "plain",
    "text": "Complete song lyrics as plain text"
  }
}
```

Not found:
```json
{
  "found": false,
  "error": "Lyrics not found for this song"
}
```

### MPD Integration

When lyrics are available for the current song, the player metadata includes additional fields:

- `lyrics_available`: Boolean indicating if lyrics exist for this song
- `lyrics_url`: Direct API endpoint for lyrics by song ID (e.g., `/api/lyrics/mpd/{base64_encoded_path}`)
- `lyrics_metadata`: Object containing the song metadata that can be used for POST requests to `/api/lyrics/mpd`

**Example song metadata with lyrics:**
```json
{
  "title": "Example Song",
  "artist": "Example Artist",
  "album": "Example Album",
  "metadata": {
    "lyrics_available": true,
    "lyrics_url": "/api/lyrics/mpd/bXVzaWMvRXhhbXBsZSBBcnRpc3QvRXhhbXBsZSBBbGJ1bS9FeGFtcGxlIFNvbmcuZmxhYw",
    "lyrics_metadata": {
      "artist": "Example Artist",
      "title": "Example Song",
      "album": "Example Album",
      "duration": 180.5
    }
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
- Use the `lyrics_url` for a direct GET request to retrieve lyrics for this specific song
- Use the `lyrics_metadata` object as the request body for a POST to `/api/lyrics/mpd` to find lyrics by metadata

## Cover Art API

The Cover Art API provides endpoints to retrieve cover art from registered providers with comprehensive image metadata. All text parameters must be encoded using URL-safe base64 encoding.

**Enhanced Response Format**: The API returns image metadata including dimensions, file size, and format information for each cover art image, enabling clients to select the most appropriate image based on their requirements.

### URL-Safe Base64 Encoding

Text parameters (artist names, song titles, album titles, URLs) must be encoded using URL-safe base64 encoding without padding. This ensures proper handling of special characters and Unicode text.

**Example encoding:**
```bash
# Using command line tools
echo -n "The Beatles" | base64 -w 0 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '='
# Result: VGhlIEJlYXRsZXM
```

  }
  ```

#### Example

# List all cover art methods and their providers
curl http://<device-ip>:1080/api/coverart/methods
```

### Cover Art Response Format

All cover art endpoints return results grouped by provider, with each provider containing:

- **Provider Information**:
  - `name`: Internal provider identifier (string)
  - `display_name`: Human-readable provider name (string)
- **Images**: Array of cover art image objects, each containing:
  - `url`: Direct URL or file path to the cover art image (string)
  - `width`: Image width in pixels (integer, optional)
  - `height`: Image height in pixels (integer, optional) 
  - `size_bytes`: File size in bytes (integer, optional)
  - `format`: Image format (string, optional) - Common formats: "JPEG", "PNG", "GIF", "WebP", "BMP"

**URL Types**: Cover art URLs can be:

1. **HTTP/HTTPS URLs**: Direct links to online cover art images
2. **Local file paths**: Paths to locally cached or extracted cover art files (with `file://` prefix)
3. **Data URLs**: Base64-encoded image data (for small images, with `data:image/` prefix)

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "provider": {
        "name": "provider_internal_name",
        "display_name": "Human Readable Provider Name"
      },
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
          "width": 1000,
          "height": 1000,
          "size_bytes": 234567,
          "format": "JPEG"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Metadata Fields**: The optional metadata fields provide additional information to help clients select the most appropriate image:
- **Dimensions** (`width`, `height`): Enable selection based on resolution requirements
- **File Size** (`size_bytes`): Useful for bandwidth-conscious applications
- **Format** (`format`): Allows format-specific handling (e.g., preferring PNG for transparency)

The client application should handle all URL types appropriately and can use the metadata to select optimal images for their use case.

### Error Handling

- **Invalid base64 encoding**: Returns empty `results` array with warning logged
- **No providers registered**: Returns empty `results` array  
- **Provider errors**: Individual provider failures are handled gracefully; successful providers still return results
- **No results found**: Returns empty `results` array when no providers find cover art

**Error Response Example**:
```json
{
  "results": []
}
```

### Provider Registration

Cover art providers can be registered programmatically using the global cover art manager:

```rust
use crate::helpers::coverart::{get_coverart_manager, CoverartProvider};

// Register a new provider
let manager = get_coverart_manager();
let mut manager_lock = manager.lock().unwrap();
manager_lock.register_provider(Arc::new(my_provider));
```

### Settings API Notes

**Key Format**: 
- Settings keys can contain any UTF-8 characters including non-ASCII characters
- Common convention is to use dot-separated hierarchical keys (e.g., `audio.volume.default`)
- Keys are case-sensitive

**Value Types**: 
- The settings database supports any JSON-serializable value types:
  - Strings: `"hello world"`
  - Numbers: `42`, `3.14`
  - Booleans: `true`, `false`
  - Objects: `{"key": "value"}`
  - Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Null: `null`

**Persistence**: 
- Settings are automatically persisted to the database
- Changes take effect immediately
- Some settings may require application restart to be fully applied

**Security**: 
- No authentication or authorization is currently implemented
- All settings are accessible via the API
- Consider network security when exposing the API

## Generic Player Controller

The `GenericPlayerController` provides a configurable player that can be controlled entirely through the API events. It maintains internal state and can be used to represent external players or services that are controlled through the Audiocontrol API.

### Configuration

Multiple generic players can be configured in the JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "generic_player_1": {
    "type": "generic",
    "name": "generic_player_1",
    "display_name": "Generic Player 1",
    "enable": true,
    "supports_api_events": true,
    "capabilities": ["play", "pause", "stop", "next", "previous", "seek", "shuffle", "loop"],
    "initial_state": "stopped",
    "shuffle": false,
    "loop_mode": "none"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `name`: Unique identifier for the player instance
- `display_name`: Human-readable name for the player
- `enable`: Whether the player is enabled (default: true)
- `supports_api_events`: Whether the player accepts API events (default: true)
- `capabilities`: Array of supported capabilities (default: ["play", "pause", "stop", "next", "previous"])
- `initial_state`: Initial playback state ("playing", "paused", "stopped")
- `shuffle`: Initial shuffle state (default: false)
- `loop_mode`: Initial loop mode ("none", "song", "playlist")

### Available Capabilities

- `play`: Can start playback
- `pause`: Can pause playback
- `stop`: Can stop playback
- `next`: Can skip to next track
- `previous`: Can skip to previous track
- `seek`: Can seek within track
- `shuffle`: Can toggle shuffle mode
- `loop`: Can set loop mode
- `queue`: Can manage queue
- `volume`: Can control volume

### API Events

The generic player responds to the standard player event API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/player/generic_player_1/update" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "song_changed",
    "song": {
      "title": "Song Title",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "album": "Album Name",
      "duration": 240.5
    }
  }'
```

### Supported Event Types

- `state_changed`: Update playback state
- `song_changed`: Update current song
- `position_changed`: Update playback position
- `loop_mode_changed`: Update loop mode
- `shuffle_changed`: Update shuffle state

### Example API Events

#### State Change

  "type": "position_changed",
  "position": 120.5
}
```

### Multiple Instances

Multiple generic players can be configured with different names and used independently:

```json
{
  "player_a": {
    "type": "generic",
    "name": "player_a",
    "display_name": "Player A",
    "capabilities": ["play", "pause", "stop"]

    "name": "player_b", 
    "display_name": "Player B",
    "capabilities": ["play", "pause", "stop", "next", "previous", "seek"]
  }
}
```

Each instance has its own API endpoint:

- `POST /api/player/player_a/update`
