# AudioControl Project - Status Summary

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive audio control system with a generic player API, extensible player controllers, and command-line tools for managing audio playback.

## Recent Completed Work

### 1. GenericPlayerController Implementation
- **Location**: `src/players/generic/`
- **Features**:
  - Configurable via JSON
  - Multiple instance support
  - Internal state management
  - API event processing
  - Full PlayerController trait implementation

### 2. Command-Line Event Client
- **Binary**: `audiocontrol_player_event_client`
- **Location**: `src/tools/acr_player_event_client.rs`
- **Features**:
  - Send state-changed events
  - Send song-changed events
  - Send position-changed events
  - Send shuffle-changed events
  - Send loop-mode-changed events
  - Send queue-changed events
  - Send custom JSON events
  - Full command-line interface with help

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: 33 tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: CLI tool functionality
- **Coverage**: GenericPlayerController, API events, command parsing

### 4. Documentation
- **GenericPlayerController**: `doc/GenericPlayerController.md`
- **Player Event Client**: `doc/player-event-client.md`
- **Man Pages**: `debian/man/audiocontrol_player_event_client.1`

## Key Features Implemented

### GenericPlayerController
- ✅ JSON configuration support
- ✅ Multiple instance capability
- ✅ Internal state management (song, position, shuffle, loop mode, queue)
- ✅ API event processing
- ✅ Full PlayerController trait compliance
- ✅ Organized in modular directory structure

### Player Event Client
- ✅ State change events (playing, paused, stopped)
- ✅ Song change events (title, artist, album, duration, URI)
- ✅ Position change events
- ✅ Shuffle mode events
- ✅ Loop mode events
- ✅ Queue management events
- ✅ Custom JSON event support
- ✅ Comprehensive help system
- ✅ Man page documentation

### Code Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (33 tests)
- ✅ Integration tests for CLI tool
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Modular architecture
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Usage Examples

### Starting with Generic Player
```bash
# Create configuration
cat > config.json << EOF
{
  "my_player": {
    "type": "generic",
    "name": "my_player",
    "display_name": "My Player",
    "enable": true,
    "supports_api_events": true,
    "initial_state": "stopped"
  }
}
EOF

# Start AudioControl
./audiocontrol --config config.json
```

### Using the Event Client
```bash
# Change state
audiocontrol_player_event_client my_player state-changed playing

# Update song
audiocontrol_player_event_client my_player song-changed \
  --title "My Song" \
  --artist "My Artist" \
  --album "My Album"

# Send custom event
audiocontrol_player_event_client my_player custom \
  '{"type": "custom_event", "data": {"key": "value"}}'
```

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests: ✅ 33/33 Passing
- EventBus functionality
- Retry mechanisms
- Security store
- SystemD helpers
- **GenericPlayerController**: 18 comprehensive tests
- LMS server discovery

### Integration Tests: ✅ CLI Tool Functionality
- Help output verification
- Command parsing
- Error handling
- Version information

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with multiple generic players
2. **Extended API**: Additional event types or configuration options
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics for generic players
4. **Advanced Features**: Playlist management, advanced queue operations

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Build specific binary
cargo build --bin audiocontrol_player_event_client

# Run CLI tool
./target/debug/audiocontrol_player_event_client --help
```

## Summary
